Example :

Taking an example of java, please consider python

          if INPUT== A , method1(arg1);  //call method1 if the input is A,
          
          if INPUT== B , method(arg1,arg2); //call method2 if input is B ..
          
          //a try catch to validate the input, should not call the methond if it is not a valid string
          //a check to validate the a regX pattern of the arg1
          //pattern = ip-172-61-49-90.eu-central-1.compute.internal
          //if patter is not matching throw error         
}


Task2:
You will have a dictionary 

{
    'Certificate': 'string',
    'CertificateChain': 'string'
}

parse this first string Certificate to a seperate file and store it is a file1.cert

the second string will be like this :

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----                      //1
content of your domain certificate               //2
-----END CERTIFICATE-----                        //3
...
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----                     //4
content of any intermediate CA certificate      //5
-----END CERTIFICATE-----                       //6
...
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
content of root CA certeficate
-----END CERTIFICATE-----


have to write from //1 to //3 into file called file2.cert
have to write from //4 to //6 into file called file3.cert
